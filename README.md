Technologies Used

#### Python Pandas
#### Scikit Learn

As a first step the dataset is prepared for analysis by cleaning the data and removing outliers. Once the data cleaning step is complete various classification models are constructed to make predictions.

The model construction step also involves hyperparamater tuning and cross validation. Various models are compared with each other for accuracy.
